🎲 Lotto Simulator – 6 out of 49 (Match All 6 Only)
This Lotto Simulator calculates how many lottery draws are needed until a single ticket matches all 6 numbers correctly – that is, a full match (6 out of 6) in the classic 6 out of 49 game, without the Super Number and without any additional lotteries.

🔧 How It Works
A fixed lottery ticket is generated with 6 unique random numbers (between 1 and 49).

The simulator continuously draws new sets of 6 winning numbers.

The simulation runs until all 6 numbers on the ticket exactly match the drawn numbers.

At the end, the simulator displays the total number of draws it took to win with 6 correct numbers.

A final button offers a realistic or humorous comparison of what might be a better investment than waiting for this rare win.

🎯 Purpose of the Project
This simulator aims to demonstrate just how unlikely it is to win the jackpot (6 correct numbers) in a 6/49 lottery.
The optional comparison serves as a thought-provoking or humorous reminder that there are often smarter ways to use your time and money than hoping for the big win.
